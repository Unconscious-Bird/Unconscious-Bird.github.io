      <h1>Why Skyrim VR is terrible yet godly</h1>

      <p>
        Quite frankly the first time I ever stepped into the universe of Skyrim
        VR, I was just a little dissapointed. The game itself felt quite dull
        and boring, nothing like the original Skyrim. Hearing about Skyrim VR
        made me very excited as I had previously loved the original Skyrim and a
        VR experience with the same very content seemed like the perfect breath
        of fresh air. But i was completely dissapointed. <br /><br />

        When i booted into the game it looked very nice, that was until I raised
        my hands up. It was a weird choice for Bethesda but in Skyrim VR for
        some unknown reason, they decided to <b>not</b> give the character a
        body. Your hands are just detached from all of realiy and you're just a
        floating head with some floating hands. I got a bit grumpy over it and
        carried on. During the tutorial you stumble into a lot of different
        items that you can pickup into your inventory etc. But if you try to
        example pick the items up with your hands... That won't really happen.
        Instead of acting as you'd expect being able to grapple the item with
        your musclular grabby hands. your hand vanishes into nothingness and the
        item is slightly affected by how you move your real hand. quite frankly
        this made me feel like an absolute ghost as what I hoped for was a world
        with endless posibilities where you could do anything you set your mind
        to. Instead I can't even a pick up a pint and pretend to get drunk. Or
        harass the locals by throwing pieces of gold at them. 3/10 boring game.
        <br /><br />
        That's what I thought for a while as I left it there to rot in my steam
        library along with tons of other games that I'll probably never play
        again. But I decided to check out what others thought. To absolutely no
        ones surprise everyone felt the same way but since Skyrim VR is a direct
        port of it's brother, Skyrim Special Edition. It allows for some pretty
        spicy stuff. Modding.
        <br /><br />
        As I delved into the corners of the internet looking for mods that would
        fix all these problems and oh boy did I find them. Almost every possible
        mod for Skyrim SE also is able to run on Skyrim VR, and if you haven't
        heard about the wonders of the Skyrim modding community, let me tell
        you. It is by far the most active modding community I have ever laid my
        eyes on. Mods for Skyrim are extremely easy to apply and can do the most
        insane and crazy things, such as turing Skyrim (a completely single
        player game) into a full on Multiplayer experience with up to hundreds
        of players WITH MOD SUPPORT??? If that isn't crazy, I don't know what
        is.
        <br /><br />
        So back to my findings. First mod I just had to get was an extremely
        popular mod called VRIK. I would tell you what that means but frankly I
        have no idea. For all I know it could be saying Virtual Radioactive
        Incell Karp. Well... It probably doesn't BUT IT COULD! maybe...
        Nevertheless VRIK is a mod that allows you to see your own body and
        more. For once i could actually see my arms when stretching them
        forward. But since the game cannot actually track my arms the game makes
        some assumptions about how human movement works. In the beggining it
        felt a bit weird but overtime my real limbs started acting like they did
        in game. Which made it feel as if I was there It was a really surreal
        feeling when i took my controller and pushed down on my arm and actually
        felt the fleshy texture of my real arm as I saw my virtual hand touching
        my virtual arm.
        <br /><br />
        It was weird to experience but it made the game 100x more immersive.
        Anothing that VRIK adds is holsters. Which are fixed positions on your
        body that when grabbed will equip items. This allows you to shoot a
        coupld arrows with your bow the pop it over your shoulder and grab your
        sword holstered on your hip. Instead of the vanilla unmodded experience
        of having to basically pause the game and scroll through super annoying
        menus until you find the weapon you want. Overall this mod made me fall
        in love with the game and made me to dig deeper.
        <br /><br />
        The next mod I'd like to talk about is HIGGS (might be Happy Is Gone
        Girl Squidward correct me if I'm wrong). HIGGS came of as a bit creepy
        at the start if im completely honest. The mod allows you to grab NPCs
        and Object in your surrounding area with realistic effects. For example
        if you decided to run around in the city of riften and suddenly started
        grabbing the face of a guard. He probably won't get very happy and he
        eventually arrests you. This allows for so much more immersion as I now
        can annoy the locals by throwing gold coins at them! 10/10 best game.
        <br /><br />
        There are tons of experiences waiting to be made in Skyrim SE and Skyrim
        VR and despite the original Skyrim being over 12 years ago, Its modding
        community continues to blossom and stay strong. It barely goes a few
        weeks in between each new truely revolutional mod. Up to 100 mods are
        made and published everyday and the number doesn't seem to be declining
        any time soon. If you ever feel like getting Skyrim VR I'd definately
        recommend you wait for a Steam sale as the game usually can go down
        40-50% in price. And keep in mind I recommend you also play the game a
        little without any mods at first to really appreciate the effect that
        these mods give you. But yeah that's all for me and lets hope I convince
        myself to write another post before the end of the year.
        <br /><br />
        Adios
